Things will be forgotten if it is not written down. Thus, I am going to take notes on things that have learned.

Recently, I begin to learn things that are beyong GIS and statistics. For example, mongodb, creatly, D3, shiny and so many good stuff. It is a shame that I don't record all the tiny little things that I have learned.

I must continue to learn and grow. So I will also take notes on GIS and statistics.
