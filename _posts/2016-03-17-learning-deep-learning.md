AlphaGo....Now the internet is flood with news about AlphaGo. It is a computer program which knows about the GO. Not only that, it recently beats the world's Champion of Go. Its fame brought a lot of attention on the deep learning technques, cause is the brain of alphaGo. Two years ago, the deep learning was already a very hot topic. Now it is even hotter. 

But should I learn about it? .....I don't want to....since I like simple things. Simple algorithms....like classic logistic regression. It is so simple and nobody can get it wrong...It is also working...when all the algorithms fails you, you can still count on logistic regression. 

.....

BUT....they made it incredibly easy to learn deep learning using python. They build a library. they provided examples....It felt like a waste of resources if you don't learn it....

DAMN....
