title: Learning D3-3
---



I am continue to learn D3. The goal is leverage D3's charting functions to build interesting GIS apps using ArcGIS Javascript API. 

I have got a book and a few interesting examples on D3. I tried to write a few lines by myself. However, sometimes, I couldn't get things right. 

Now, I found this website [Dashing D3](https://www.dashingd3js.com/). This is the best tutorial I ever know. It starts with the basics of html and then it gave you a whole picture. 

skeleton of my learning: css, dom, svg, chain syntax, select, append....


Once I finish reading this tutorial, all I need to do is to design my app. My first app is simple. I want to have a web showing spatial connections between events. 

I would have a time slider to control time. I will have a chart to show the distribution of event counts. There will be a map showing events as glowing balls. 

My second app is based on the first app. It would show clusters. Various clusters. Mostly context related clusters. 

For my second app, I probably would need a data server. Once I finish building these two apps, I should be able to build any apps for event related solutions. Later I can add more functions to it, for example, hovering point detection, anormally detection, association rule mining. 

I will add bit by bit......Hopefully, later I can get some publication out of this project. This publication is for 2017.
